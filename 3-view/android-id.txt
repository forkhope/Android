#### 描述Android XML资源文件中的 android:id 属性 ####
This provides a unique identifier for the view, which you can use to
reference the object from your app code, such as to read and manipulate
the object (you'll see this in the next lesson).
The at sign (@) is required when you're referring to any resource object
from XML. It is followed by the resource type (id in this case), a slash,
then the resource name (edit_message).

The plus sign (+) before the resource type is needed only when you're
defining a resource ID for the first time. When you compile the app, the
SDK tools use the ID name to create a new resource ID in your project's
gen/R.java file that refers to the EditText element. Once the resource ID
is declared once this way, other references to the ID do not need the plus
sign. Using the plus sign is necessary only when specifying a new resource
ID and not needed for concrete resources such as strings or layouts.

即,在XML文件中引用资源对象时,都要使用 '@' 符号.
只有在第一次定义资源ID(resource ID)时,需要使用 '+' 符号.

另外,假设在XML文件中有如下定义:
<EditText android:id="@+id/edit_message"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:hint="@string/edit_message" />
可以看到, "@+id" 和 "@string" 有相同的名字.这个说是可以接受的,描述如下:
This string resource has the same name as the element ID: edit_message.
However, references to resources are always scoped by the resource type
(such as id or string), so using the same name does not cause collisions.
