#### 为<Button>组件添加点击事件 ####
To respond to the button's on-click event, open the layout file and add the
"android:onClick" attribute to the <Button> element:
    <Button
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="@string/button_send"
        android:onClick="sendMessage" />
The "android:onClick" attribute's value, "sendMessage", is the name of a
method in your activity that the system calls when the user clicks the
button. Etc., Open the MainActivity class and add the corresponding method:
    /** Called when the user clicks the Send button */
    public void sendMessage(View view) {
        // Do something in response to button
    }
In order for the system to match this method to the method name given to
"android:onClick", the signature must be exactly as shown. Specifically,
the method must:
> Be public
> Have a void return value
> Have a View as the only parameter (this will be the View that was clicked)
